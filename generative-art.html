<p>Here is my collection of generated art.

Please see my <a href="art/2016/09/14/on-generative-art">essay</a> in the blog too.</p>

<h1>Contour figures</h1>
<p>Drawing something that feels alive and has a human touch to it.
This kind of thing is natural by hand.
But that kind of expressiveness and richness of detail,
can it be simulated in generative art too –
and how then should computer images speak
in a non-obvious way,
with aesthetic and emotional appeal?</p>

<p>Can there be authentically erotic, or humorous, or touching,
generative art, and with what cost?</p>

<p>These may seem rhetoric or blatant questions,
but I think they need a good answer.
No artist thinks, I believe, to be able to secure it,
but for me, both form and detail have a part in it.</p>

<p class="img-text">The Venus of Sine (variation ACU), 2016/09/17.</p>


<p>This is first one in a series of hominids I crafted
when such figurative–generative idea started to intrigue me.
The body is shaped by two overlayed sine functions
and its head is modeled separately.</p>

<h1>Sense of the environment</h1>
<p>One thing that comes naturally to the eye is recognizing relatively
uniform arrays of things. In cave paintings figures stand side by side,
distinct from each other, possessing their own space on the wall.
This uniform randomness is surprisingly difficult to generate
and maintain.
</p>

<p>In nature, it represents itself in many things formed gradually by immense energy:
the waves, the wind, the rocks, grains of sand, the rhythm of the trees in a forest.
Rhythm is a universal visual experience that generative art can highlight.</p>
