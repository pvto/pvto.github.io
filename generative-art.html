<p>Here is an entry point into my growing repository of generated art.

Please see my <a href="art/2016/09/14/on-generative-art">essay</a> in the blog too.</p>

<h1>Contour figures</h1>
<p>Drawing something that feels alive and has a human touch to it
– it feels natural to do by hand (or by foot).</p>

<p>But the expressiveness and richness of detail
that we associate with artistic craft,
could it be simulated in generative art –
and by what means could computer images speak
in a non-obvious way,
with aesthetic and emotional appeal?
Can there be authentically erotic, or humorous, or touching,
generative art, and with what cost?</p>

<p>These may seem rhetoric or blatant questions,
but I think they need a good answer,
especially because art and design are being ever more digitalized.
And while some things become easier with the computer,
some earlierly obvious things
may even be forgotten altogether.

<p class="img-text">The Venus of Sine (variation ACU), 2016/09.</p>


<p>This is first one in a series of hominids I crafted
when this idea of emotional figurative aspect in generative art
started to intrigue me.
Its body is shaped by two overlayed sine functions
and its head is modeled separately.
So it is "purely" generative.</p>

<h1>Fractal procedures</h1>

<p>Fractals are an essential part of generative art,
but again, how would they relate to more general human experience,
outside of mathematical systems,
if such a relation is possible?

<h1>Sense of the environment</h1>
<p>One thing that comes naturally to the eye is recognizing relatively
uniform arrays of things. In cave paintings figures stand side by side,
distinct from each other, possessing their own space on the wall.
This uniform randomness is surprisingly difficult to generate
and maintain.
</p>

<p>In nature, it represents itself in many things formed gradually by immense energy:
the waves, the wind, the rocks, grains of sand, the rhythm of the trees in a forest.
</p>

<p>Once again, my own intuitive reaction to recurring and rhytmic processes
seems the "key" part here. What I find rhytmically stimulating is probably
that for a good reason. Not unlike music,
generative art creates an astonishing possibility
to explore rhytmical interactions and the overlapping of different rhythms.
